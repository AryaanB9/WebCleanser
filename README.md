![](./images/image1.png)

# Introduction

**Web Cleanser** was created with the typical internet user in mind, who must navigate among several websites while online and risk falling for a trap from a bad website that may be after the user's information or seeks to infect their machine with malware. Our Chrome plugin allows users to utilise our uniquely trained ML model to determine if a specific website is safe to browse.

# How it Works ?

<!-- ![](./images/flow.jpeg) -->



The ML model extracts the following features from a url :


  
| Feattures     Used                  |                                   |                            |                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Having IP address                   | URL Length                        | URL Shortening service     | Having @ symbol     |
| Having double slash                 | Having dash symbol(Prefix Suffix) | Having multiple subdomains | SSL Final State     |  | Domain Registration Length | Favicon | HTTP or HTTPS token in domain name | Request URL |
| URL of Anchor                       | Links in tags                     | SFH - Server from Handler. | Submitting to email |
| Abnormal URL                        | IFrame                            | Age of Domain              | DNS Record          |
| Web Traffic -  using data.alexa.com | Google Index                      |                            | Statistical Reports |

## What Problem it Solves ?

In the modern day, every website on the internet seeks to gather user data by duping visitors into divulging their login information for fraud or other vengeful activities. Uninitiated browser users are unaware of the page's back end. Users might be duped into disclosing their login information or downloading malicious files.

We have developed a Chrome extension that will function as middleware between users and harmful websites, relieving users of having to provide their personal information to such websites.
Our idea was developed with the typical internet user in mind, who must go through several websites while online and risk falling for a malicious website's trap that aims to steal personal information from users or install malware. Our Chrome extension enables users to determine whether a specific website is secure before visiting it.
